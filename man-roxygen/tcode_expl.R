#' @details To allow easy input into ggplot2 functions, timestamps are made as absolute times by adding the time relative to the beginning of a session to an arbitrary origin, which should be the same across all sessions. This decision forces all sessions to appear to have been recorded starting at the same time. For this reason, events that seem to coincide between sessions, based on the timestamps, may have happened at different times.
