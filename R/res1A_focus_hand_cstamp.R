#' Codesstamps for session "res1A": Round 1, group A of the research phase
#'
#' A single _R_ list of data frames comprising coding datasets for session res1A. Each data frame holds a set of codestamps for this session. The data frame attribute "desc" is a list holding identifiers for the dataset. A dataset is uniquely described by the session ID, code type, coding method, the coder, a version ID, and the type of timed stamp.
#'
#' @format A data frame with 79 rows and 7 variables:
#' \describe{
#'   \item{Round}{The round this session was in, either 1 or 2}
#'   \item{GID}{The group for this session, either "A", "B", or "C"}
#'   \item{In}{The In mark point for this code. A character string...}
#'   \item{Out}{The Out mark point for this code. A character string...}
#'   \item{Type}{The type of code. For this dataset, the type is "focus"}
#'   \item{Bin}{The coding bin these codes cannot cross over}
#'   \item{Code}{The focus code for the interval, either "Rd", "Do", "Rp", "Ds", "O", or "Of"}
#'   \item{Coder}{The coder ID for this code. A 3-letter character string}
